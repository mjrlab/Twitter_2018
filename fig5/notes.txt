*********************************
Note on week numbering convention:
*********************************

Week numbers were obtained using the week() function in Matlab. This was
done consistently in code that assigns holidays to weeks of the year and in
the code that calculates weekly tweetograms. Calculations obey the
following convention:

1. Week 1 = first week when Jan. 1 occurs. Dec. 31 always falls in the last
week of the year (week 53). E.g., 
    week(datetime('1-Jan-2013')) = 1 (a Tuesday) and 
    week(datetime('31-Dec-2013')) = 53 (a Monday), 
even though the days fell during the same workweek. In my tweetogram 
calculations, wk1 of year N is combined with wk53 of year N-1 to ensure that
all weeks have the same number of days. Thus, data in Figure 5 only has 
weeks 1-52 of 2013 (week 53 belongs to the next year).

2. Because the analysis in this figure focuses on weekday tweetograms, I
manually assigned all holidays/dates of interest to nearest workweeks (M-F):
    - "DST start" refers to the first workweek (M-F) in DST
    - "DST end" refers to the first workweek (M-F) after transition to ST
    - "break start" is assigned to the week when break begins, even if
        less than half of the workweek falls during that break
    - "break end" is assigned to the week when the first school day after
        the break occurs, even if that day is not a Monday
    - yellow bands in Fig. 5 span the interval between "break start" 
        and "break end" weeks (e.g., if the fall break occurs during Tue-Fri
        of the 42nd week of the year, then the endpoints of the bar are [42 43]);
    - "staff days" when school is open to staff but not students were
        counted towards school breaks

3. Only school breaks containing at least two days off were considered.

4. For analysis of "summer break effect:"
    - lastDay occurs during the last workweek of the school year 
    - firstDay occurs during the first week of the school year

5. Note: the interim breaks (fall, spring) have been verified to obey this
convention only for the counties shown in Fig. 5. It is likely that for 
some other counties the break start dates have been listed as beginning 
on the week prior to the first Monday of the break. This does warning does
not apply to first and last days of the year.
